- [ ] 2 C AP Flour (305g)
- [ ] 2 C sugar (430g)
- [ ] 3/4 C cocoa powder (75g)
- [ ] 2 t baking powder (8g)
- [ ] 1 1/2 t baking soda (8g)
- [ ] 1 t salt (6g)
- [ ] 1 t espresso powder (0g)
- [ ] 1 C milk (8.55oz)
- [ ] 1/2 C coconut oil (100g)
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 2 t vanilla extract
- [ ] 1 C boiling coffee (8oz)


1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the base with parchment paper.

2. Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add both sugars and salt and whisk to blend well, pressing out any lumps of brown sugar.

3. Combine eggs, oil, sour cream and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend well. Pour into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with an electric hand mixer on medium-low until blended. It will be thick and somewhat dry. Add the hot coffee gradually in two stages to minimize clumps forming and beat until evenly combined and the batter smooth.

4. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-33 minutes until cakes spring back when pressed gently and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes before inverting onto the rack to cool completely.

## Bavarois Cream

[//]: # "Base is based on this site:

"

- [ ] 1/3 C cold water (70g)
- [ ] 2 t powdered gelatin
- [ ] 3 egg yolks
- [ ] 1/3 C sugar
- [ ] 1 C whole milk
- [ ] 1/2 t vanilla extract
- [ ] 1 C heavy cream


1. Place 1/3 cup cold water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Evenly sprinkle the gelatin on top. Set aside to bloom as you prepare the custard.

2. Create a double boiler by first filling a medium saucepan about a 1/4 of the way full with water. Gently simmer the water without boiling. Leave the water simmering as you prepare the other ingredients.

3. Using a heatproof metal bowl that fits on top of the saucepan, whip the egg yolks and sugar off the heat with a whisk until thick and light yellow in color. In a separate small saucepan, scald the milk. Slowly pour the warm milk and vanilla into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.

4. Place bowl that contains the milk and egg mixture on top of the lightly simmering pot of water. Gently cook, stirring continually with a rubber spatula until it thickens slightly, about 10-12 minutes. It should thicken enough that it coats the back of the spatula without quickly dripping off. Immediately remove from the heat, and pour the mixture through a strainer into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg pieces.

5. When the custard is strained, gently melt the bloomed gelatin by heating it in the microwave for just a few seconds, until liquid. Stir the gelatin mixture into the hot custard mixture.

6. Cool the custard in the refrigerator uncovered, stirring occasionally. Chill until it is just beginning to set but is still very soft, about 30-40 minutes.

7. While the custard is cooling, prepare the whipped cream by whisking the cold heavy cream until soft peaks form. As soon as the custard is ready, gently fold in the whipped cream until it is completely incorporated.
