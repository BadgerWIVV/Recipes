#Crock Pot Mushrooms

##Bolognese Ingredient List

- 3-4oz (1 stick) butter
- onions/onion powder
- garlic powder
- Lawry's seasoning salt
- salt
- pepper

##Instructions

 - In a large crock pot, use 2-4 larger packages of mushrooms depending on size of container but I try to get enough to fill it almost to the top.
I put 3-4 Oz (about a stick) of butter in the bottom before I start and put a layer of mushrooms in. I then top it with a healthy sprinkling of garlic powder, onion powder and garlic salt. I may put a lighter covering of Lawry's seasoning salt over it too but not necessary.
I then put another layer of mushrooms and season that layer the same. Usually end up with 3-4 layers of mushrooms and seasonings in total. Let them cook down and stir 1-2 times per hour once the brine is apparent.
I do sample one as soon as the brine softens them up to see if it tastes right or I need to add more seasonings. I'm pretty liberal with both garlic powder and onion powder but go a little lighter on the salt products and end up adding more after they cook down as not to over do it. Hard to take salt out. Lol.
Cook 4-8 hours on the lower heat setting overall and they can sit there and season on warm after that. I usually turn it to warm after about one hour of heated cooking once the brine is ready and they cook down a lot. It doesn't need to get so hot that it's boiling them (which one my crocks can happen on anything above warm).
You could substitute or add actual white onion in there for the onion flavor also if you wish. I've made it both ways and tastes pretty similar.
