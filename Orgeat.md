# Orgeat

<https://www.thespruceeats.com/orgeat-syrup-recipe-5095919>

## Ingredients

* 1 cup whole raw almonds
* 1 1/2 cups warm distilled water (about 100 F)
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon orange flower water
* 2 tablespoons brandy, or vodka; optional
* 1/4 teaspoon citric acid, optional

## Instructions

1. Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 F.
2. On a rimmed baking sheet, spread the almonds out in a single layer. Toast in the oven for 4 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes.
3. In a food processor or chopper, chop the almonds to a coarse grind (not the sand-like texture of almond flour).
4. Transfer the ground almonds to a large bowl and cover them with warm water. Let soak for 1 to 3 hours, depending on how strong you would like the almond flavor.
5. Using a fine-mesh strainer and two large layers of cheesecloth, squeeze all of the liquid from the almonds into a deep bowl. The almond pulp should be almost completely dry and you'll have about 1 cup of liquid.
6. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, gently warm the almond liquid.
7. Whisk in the sugar and continue stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
8. Strain the orgeat syrup through two layers of clean cheesecloth. Stir in the orange flower water and, if using, the brandy or vodka and citric acid.
9. Once the syrup has cooled completely, transfer it to a bottle with a tight-sealing lid. Refrigerate the orgeat syrup and shake before using it in your favorite drinks. 

## How to Store

Orgeat should be kept refrigerated. With the liquor and citric acid, the homemade orgeat syrup will keep well for up to 2 months. Without those preservatives, use the syrup within 1 week.
